# Install the IDE

## Install Visual Studio Code
All demonstrations and videos this semester will use Visual Studio Code as the IDE (integrated development environment). I strongly urge you to use VS Code for your own development â€“ it has Git integration, code highlighting and syntax, and a built-in terminal that will help you run your applications locally.

`````{admonition} Pro Tip!
:class: tip

Visual Studio **Code** is a free, open-source code editor. It is different from the complete Visual Studio package.

You'll often see it referred to as "VS Code" or just "Code", but it should not be confused with Visual Studio.
`````

1. [Download the correct VS Code for your operating system and processor](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

`````{note}
During the installation you are given the option to add "Open with Code" actions to your Windows Explorer menu. This is **very** convenient and I highly recommend you choose all of these available options!
