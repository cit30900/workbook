# Install the IDE

(devenv:windows:vscode)=
## Install Visual Studio Code
I *strongly* recommend that you use Visual Studio Code as your IDE for this course. All tutorials and examples will use VS Code, and functionality of the IDE will be referred to frequently.

Visual Studio Code is *a different software package* than "Visual Studio". VS Code is free and open source.

* [Download the correct VS Code for your operating system and processor](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
