# Using Windows

You are required to install several software packages on your personal computer to complete the work in this course. These packages include *Python* (and various Python libraries), *Git*, and *Visual Studio Code*. All of the software required by this course is free to students.

There are several different ways to install the software you'll need in this course. I'm recommending one method that will keep us using *mostly* the same workflow. If you choose to install your software different, I will not be able to support you and your personal computer.
